title: Stupid Shit Hackathon

Over the weekend I had the opportunity to participate in the [Stupid Shit Hackathon that No One Needs And Terrible Ideas](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/). My team took apart an old NeuroSky EEG monitor toy, a disposable camera, and an arduino and made something truly stupid that no one needed: a meditation aid that shocks you into zen. It's a combination of pavlovian conditioning and the recent "mindfulness" trend gone horribly wrong. Check out our video demo below:
