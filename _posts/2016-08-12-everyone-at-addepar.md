title: Everyone at Addepar

For the Addepar Summer 2016 Hackathon, I wanted to deviate from the traditional engineering-focused project. I wanted to push past the boundaries of a skill that previously I had only scratched the surface. I don't consider myself an illustrator by any means, so I settled on portraiture, the one subject I never quite got the hang of in the one drawing class I took in college. Inspired by [Every Person in New York](http://everypersoninnewyork.blogspot.com/), I decided I would draw portraits of every person working at Addepar.

Traditionally, Addepar's hackathons are two and a half days long with people rarely staying past the standard office hours. At the time, Addepar had 214 employees. I estimated I could spend at most 5 minutes per portrait and still finish them all before the deadline. Given that I am both a perfectionist and prone to taking frequent breaks, I gave myself a few rules to keep from going crazy:

1. No do-overs, or else I'd spend 3 days redrawing the same portrait and I would still be unsatisfied
2. No looking at the paper while you draw (this is often called "blind portraits")
3. No competing - I had already won or placed in the past two hackathons

After I was done, I arranged all of the portraits together in a poster that now hangs in each of Addepar's three offices.

In the process, I realized that some of my coworkers took on the likeness of a few celebrities:

*Barack Obama, Craig Robinson, and Larry King*

And some looked like characters from characters from Bojack Horseman:

*Vincent Adult-man, Herb Kazzaz, and A Ryan Seacrest Type*

And that I look terrifying:

But most importantly, this project was _fun_. I got to try something new and make my coworkers laugh. And I learned that if software engineering doesn't work out, maybe the animators on Bojack Horseman will hire me.
